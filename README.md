# line_integrals_fuel_efficiency
## Proof of Concept
### Goals
<ul>
  <li>Calculate hypothetical fuel consumed along a route based on MPG and speed limits</li>
  <li>
    Use a regression model to use user data to predict actual user speed from speed limit
    <ul>
      <li>Regression Model is personalized per individual</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate Decrease in MPG over a given route based on projected speed
    <ul><li>Select optimal route based on MPG calculation</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Google Maps-like app on the frontend to select an optimal fuel route and navigate it
  </li>
</ul>

### Current State
This project currently has the backend/api working, but to enable it I need to pay for Google Cloud credit. Once I have tested the API thouroughly, I will being work on a frontend iOS app.
