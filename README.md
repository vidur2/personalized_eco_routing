# line_integrals_fuel_efficiency
## Proof of Concept
**Goals:**
<ul>
  <li>Calculate hypothetical fuel consumed along a route based on MPG and speed limits</li>
  <li>
    Use a regression model to use user data to predict actual user speed from speed limit
    <ul>
      <li>Regression Model is personalized per individual</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate Decrease in MPG over a given route based on projected speed
    <ul><li>Select optimal route based on MPG calculation</li></ul>
  </li>
</ul>
