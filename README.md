# line_integrals_fuel_efficiency
## Proof of Concept
Goals:
<ol>
  <li>Calculate hypothetical fuel consumed along a route based on MPG and speed limits</li>
  <li>
    Use a regression model to use user data to predict actual user speed from speed limit
    <ol>
      <li>Regression Model is personalized per individual</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate Decrease in MPG over a given route based on projected speed
    <ol><li>Select optimal route based on MPG calculation</li></ol>
  </li>
</ol>
